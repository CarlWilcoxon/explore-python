# Exploring New Programming Languages

We've explored server-side programming with JavaScript, but there are many other options out there. In this assignment, we're going to take a look at some of them.

- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Java

Each group will be assigned to work with one of these new languages. If you want to learn others, you'll have plenty of time to follow up with other languages later on. While they are all different, they are all widely used for web application development.

There won't be a lot of information here on exactly what you should do. There are some pointers here to get you started, but you'll need to do a lot research on your own. 

To help, you'll be grouped with others working on the same language. Work through the assignment yourself, but check in with your group to share what you are learning, useful resources, and ask questions.

## Objectives

- install tools required to work with a new language
- explore basic syntax (variables, types, data structures, loops, conditionals, functions) of new language
- solve a whiteboard logic problem in a new language
- document and share what you've learned in a GitHub readme


## Install

Working with a new language means you'll need some new tools. Start by figuring out what you need to install to get started. When doing development on a Mac, Homebrew is a good starting point. 

Search the web for how to get setup with your assigned language __using Homebrew.__

> Note: Homebrew is nice because it allows you to keep the version of languages you use for development separate from what might be installed by your OS. Many language also provide tools that help you manage the version of the language used across different projects (`pyenv` for python, or `rbenv` for ruby).


## Hello World

A great place to get started with a new language is by making a Hello World program. 

Search the web for a basic Hello World tutorial for your assigned language to get things started. 

> For anything other than PHP, don't worry about the web yet, just get a simple program running on the command line. PHP was made for the web. So if you are working with PHP, you'll be diving into the web right away.


## Basic syntax

Hello World is a great starting point, but you'll need to sort out more language features to get a bigger application up and running. Find a language guide to help you with basic syntax for functions, conditionals, and loops.

Take some time to look into how to buff it up a bit by writing a function. Can you get it to say hello to a person by name using a function parameter? 


## Programming

After you are a bit familiar with the basic syntax, solve one of our "whiteboard" problems (FizzBuzz, reverse a string or array, LeapYear, etc.) in your new language! Do this on your computer, not on a whiteboard!


## Teach Back

Each group will spend about 10-12 minutes teaching the rest of the cohort some language basics. Each person in the group should talk and walk through some code. 

Here is a list of things you should talk about: 

1. Basic Hello World w/ variables & types :
    - how to make a variable (do variables have types?)
    - write to console

2. Data structures and loops:
    - arrays or lists
    - objects

3. Functions and conditionals:
    - write a function that takes arguments and returns a value (sum 2 numbers)
    - operators - math, logical (and/or/not)

4. Pull things together. Solve a whiteboard problem (FizzBuzz, reverse a string or array, LeapYear, etc.)


### GitHub Repo

Setup a new GitHub repo for your group with a README file that has instruction for installing the new language tools & resources your group found useful. Then add some notes with an example of each of the items listed above for the teachback presentation.

When you are done, complete the assignment on the portal and share your GitHub repo in the cohort Slack channel. It will be a good starting point for others who are interested in learning this language.
